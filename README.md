# Quick start

### 1. Install dependencies

```
npm i
```

### 2. Startup dev environment

The site is built using Gatsby and Express to make authenticated API calls to CoinGecko API.

Start up the Gatsby site which hot reloads changes to the frontend at `localhost:8000`.

```
npm start
```

In a seperate shell startup the Express server to act as Netlify's serverless function calls using `axios`.

```
npm run server
```

### 3. Start coding

Editing content in the `src` directory will auto refresh in the browser at `localhost:8000`.

# Database

The `database` folder contains code for a daily cron job that runs to update past prices of crypto coins.
